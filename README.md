## Requirements
Download all the required packages in a new conda enviornment. 
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
You should have a GPU of sufficient memory if you want to run the training/evaluation in batches, for lower memory GPUs run using a batch size of 1. 

To run inference on the pre-trained methods download a subet of the validation dataset at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16PskzHb4IJYeXGBnryjGSESgDx9dGfkE?usp=sharing. 

Make sure to change the file paths in all the relevent locations in the code to ensure the correct location of data on your machine. 

## Simulating_Motion
To start from the fast_mri dataset, first download the dataset from the original fast_mri dataset (<https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/>). Beware the dataset is quite large around ~2TB as it contains the raw kspace data for multiple coil acquisition. To generate the MVUE single coil images, run the following script:
```
python fastmri_convertor.py
```
Remember to change the location of fast_mri dataset on your machine. 
To generate the motion corrupt images run the following script with the correct input and output file paths on your machine:
```
$ python motion_gen.py
```

## U-Net
If you want to train either UNET or GAN from scratch, run the following bash script with selection of appropriate hyper-parameters:
```
bash bash_training_jobs.sh
```
This will run the training for different hyper-parameters and chooose the ones which give the best performance. 
If you just want to do inference, then download the pre-trained U-Net model parameters from the following drive (<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W5BYIJeQLlEkPHhLCQmOJYlm2LWSN1Ie?usp=sharing>).
## GAN
To do GAN training from scratch, use the same script as was provided for U-Net, just change the appropriate flags. 
If you just want to do inference, then download the pre-trained GAN model parameters from the following drive (<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QO2i3CF5iduM4COoxQZykhbDOBYkUIMv?usp=sharing>).

Further, if you just want to visualize some of the test set images in a loop, you can use the following command with updated file structure:
```
python visualizer.py
```
